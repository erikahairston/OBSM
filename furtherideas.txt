This documentation is to be a userâ€™s manual for your project. 

-Though the structure of your documentation is entirely up to you, it should be 
incredibly clear to the staff how and where, if applicable, to compile, 
configure, and use your project. 

-Your documentation should be at least several paragraphs in length.
It should not be necessary for us to contact you with 
questions regarding your project after its submission. 

- Hold our hand with this documentation; be sure to answer in your documentation 
any questions that you think we might have while testing your work.
