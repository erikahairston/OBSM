Intro:
    Welcome to OBSM - a site for students to hear and see what's happening on their own campus
    and others across the world regarding the continued, but now more public, Black and SoC (students of color)
    movements. OBSM is meant to give students of color voice in a space (I hope) will be safer than social media. 
    Specifically, I created OBSM to foster a space of healing, collaboration, and transparency.

Registering/LogIn:
    In order to enter the site, you must have a US or Canadian University email address. To register, upon 
    opening the URL you will be brought to the "Log In" page. Navigate to the bottom and click "register".
    To register, you must fill out every field and can only have one login per email address. After clicking
    "Register" button, you will be logged in. 
    
    If you already have a registered account, you may type in your school email and password on the log in page. From
    the bottom of the "Register" page you can click Log In to get back to the initial "Log In" screen.
    You officially have an account setup!
    
Home(Index) Screen & Navigation Bar:
    Once logged in, you will be brought to your "Home" page that should welcome you. On this screen, if you or other
    students from your school (that you registered with) have posted on the site before, the "Home" page displays 
    all posts from students that go to your school. Once logged in, you will now see a navigation bar at the top of
    your screen. The black, red, and green fist image is a link back to the "Home" page from wherever you are on the site. 
    "My Moves & Voice, Contribute, Gives Me Life, Our Voices, and Log Out" All are links to different pages that I explain
    below.
 
  Posts:      
    As you saw on the homepage, there was a vertical timeline of posts by members from your school. On the every page, posts 
    are organized by most recent on the top and can contain: images, video, gifs, and text. Each post is timestamped and the
    person who posted it has their name next to their post. The icons next to each post represent its category. There are 
    4 post categories: 1. "Feed Soul":   camera icon
                       2. "Woke Classes":  pencil icon
                       3. "Required Reading": quote (") icon
                       4. "Announcements": video-camera icon

MyMoves & Voice:
    If you click on the first link of the navigation bar, "MyMoves & Voice", you will be led to a similar looking page with a timeline
    of posts; however, they will all be posts by you. If you have not created any posts yet, you'll see any apology page
    letting you know why you don't see posts. But, don't fret. I will show you how to make some!
    
Contribute:
    On the navigation bar, if you click on the 2nd link, "Contribute", you will be brought to a form page of 4 buttons.
    Each button represents one of the categories of posts I described above. Now you may choose what you'd like to contribute.
  1. Feed Your Soul: 
        - If you wanted to post something positive, funny, restorative, or of "healing" nature for good vibes (up to your discretion),
        you can click the "Feed Our Souls" button, where you'll be brought to an "Add Soul" Upload form. In order to post a 
        "Feed Our Souls" post, you must enter a title and at least one media link. 
        
        ***If you choose to post a YOUTUBE VIDEO, you must copy & paste the URL within quotes in src from the SHARE, EMBED option
        from Youtube, into the form.  
        ***If you choose to post an image, you must copy & paste the image URL (.jpeg) into the form. 
        
        You may add a description/details if you'd like. Once you are satisfied with your content, click "Bless!" Button and you will
        brought to either a "Upload Success" or "Sorry" page. If you didn't enter the required fields or there was an error with your link,
        you will most likely be brought to the "Sorry" page, where must navigate back to "Add Souls" and start over with accurate information.
  2. Woke Classes: & 3. Required Readings:
        -If you wanted to suggest a class or that opened your eyes to new perspectives or fascinated you on race, gender, sexuality and/or their 
        intersectionalities/histories, you can do so by clicking the "Woke Classes" or " Required Readings" button from the "Contribute" page.
        
        In order to suggest a class (or book), you must provide the title and the author(or professor). No image/video nor description is required,
        but you may provide one if you feel it is relevant. Once you click "Bless!" the book or class suggestion will be available in all posts
        for users to see. 
  4.  Events/Announcements:
        -If you want to post something regarding an upcoming or past event, or have an announcement/call to action, you would click the
        "Events or Announcements" button from the "Contribute" page. This leads you to another form similar to the last 3 where you must
        provide a title and now a description or "Details". You can only include one image or video per post. Again, your video must be a
        Youtube EMBED link and your image must be a url hosted online. If you entered all accurate information, you will also be
        led to the "Upload Success" page. If not, there will be an apology and explanation.

Gives Me Life:
    Now that you've hopefully successfully made a post, let's check some out. If you click on the "Gives Me Life" tab from the
    Nav Bar, you will see a variety of posts all from the "Feed Our Souls" category. These posts come from every student from
    any school registered that has posted something in this category. 

Our Voices:
    If you want to see beyond your school, your own, and just "Feed Our Souls" category, you can do so by clicking on the
    "Our Voices" tab. You should see another form but with only a search bar. Here you can enter the name of any school that 
    you'd like to see posts from. 
    
    ***Note that everything you post on this site is searchable and viewable by any other student. However, people will only be
    able to see your first name, unless you type your last name into a post.

Log Out.
